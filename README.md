# Signature-Forgery-detection

Offline signatures play a crucial role as everyone has a unique signature that is used
mostly for personal identification and the authentication of important papers, legal
proceedings, and transactions. Offline signature verification and detection is a tricky
area with several key concerns. 

This proposed system compares the original signature with the forged one and displays the percentage
match as the output.

## Steps to execute this web page 

1. Create a folder in visual studio code and download these files and add it to those folders 
2. Create a file names Templates and Put "compare.html" and "index.html" into it.
3. create a file named "uploads" in order to save the files uploaded from the system . 
4. Now run the application using the command "python run main.py" . 

The skimage.metrics module's structural_similarity function is part of the scikit-image library, 
which is a image processing package in Python. It computes the structural similarity 
index (SSIM) between two pictures.
The structural similarity index is a metric that quantifies the similarity between two images 
based on their structural information.

This is a basic similarity check between two images and determine if forged based on the other examinations. 

Taking into account aspects other than image resemblance, such as pen pressure, rhythm, individual 
features, and expert interpretation. 

SSIM can be used for analysis process.
